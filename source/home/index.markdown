I'm a doctoral student at the University of Arizona. I'm a husband and a father
of two awesome kids.

I'm also an aspiring nerd. I love trying new technology, but I also love the old
stuff. I'm currently in the transition from Vim to Emacs, and I'm a huge fan. I
like to think of myself as a programmer, but I'm definitely not. Maybe someday.

## Research Interests

In my time at the University of Arizona, I've picked up a pretty broad spectrum
of interests. I follow a design science research methodology, and I really love
making things that have real world uses. My main research focus is on building
interactive and intelligent interfaces. I've built a chat bot based interviewing
agent and a tablet interviewing application. My dream is to one day build
Jarvis, but I've got a long way to go before then.

I study the way people interact with technology, and how to design technology
that interacts with people. I also study how deception affects that interaction.
