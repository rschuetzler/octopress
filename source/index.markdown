## Who is Ryan Schuetzler?

I am a researcher in the MIS department at the University of Arizona. My
research focuses on how people interact with new forms of technology. As part of
my work, I've built a chat bot, several websites, and an embodied conversational
agent. I love running experiments and testing out new things.

I'm also a little obsessed with doing things the "tech" way. I've converted this
site to several platforms in search of just the right one to make me feel like a
hacker when I develop it, while making it easy to do. I've picked up vim and
later converted to emacs in an effort to make my daily work writing, developing,
and doing statistics as awesome as possible. I'm a huge fan of LaTeX for writing
documents, and I'm looking forward to picking up knitr to make it even more
awesome.
